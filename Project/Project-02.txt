### QUESTION

You are given the following spatial datasets with ‘WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_45N’ 
Projection for Ward 31, Khulna City Corporation.

 a. Ward_31_KCC                     
 b. Mouza_Ward31                       
 c. Proposed_Road_Ward31
 d. Existing_Structure
 e. Existing_Road
 f. Ward_boundary_KCC

❑Find out the total number of structures based on structure type within 1 m 
 distance from the proposed road.
❑Find out the affected plots with ownership information within 1 m distance from 
 the proposed road



 ### SOLUTION

 import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.ops import unary_union
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load relevant data from the GDB
gdb_path = r"D:\GIS_File\Project\2nd-Civil Engineering Project\Road Improvement.gdb\Road Improvement.gdb"  # Change to actual path

# Load layers
structures = gpd.read_file(gdb_path, layer="Existing_Structure")
proposed_road = gpd.read_file(gdb_path, layer="Proposed_Road_Ward31")

# Step 2: Reproject to UTM Zone 45N (WGS 1984)
target_crs = "EPSG:32645"
structures = structures.to_crs(target_crs)
proposed_road = proposed_road.to_crs(target_crs)

# Step 3: Create 1 meter buffer around proposed road
buffer_1m = proposed_road.buffer(1)
road_buffer_union = unary_union(buffer_1m)

# Step 4: Identify structures within 1 meter
structures['within_1m'] = structures.geometry.intersects(road_buffer_union)
near_structures = structures[structures['within_1m']]

# Step 5: Count by structure type
structure_type_col = 'STR_TYPE'  # Change if different
structure_counts = near_structures[structure_type_col].value_counts()

print("\n✅ Structure counts within 1 meter of the proposed road:\n")
print(structure_counts)

# Step 6: Optional plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
proposed_road.plot(ax=ax, color='black', linewidth=2, label='Proposed Road')
structures.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', markersize=10, label='All Structures')
near_structures.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=20, label='Structures <1m')

plt.legend()
plt.title("Structures Within 1 Meter of Proposed Road")
plt.show()
